# plp-assignments

This repository contains solutions and code for my PLP (Power Learn Project) assignments.

## Repository Structure

- `assignment-1/`  
  Contains the first assignment, a basic calculator program written in Python.
- `assignment-2/`  
  Contains the second assignment, a Python program demonstrating basic list operations.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Basic Calculator

A simple command-line calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
See [assignment-1/README.md](assignment-1/README.md) for details.

### Assignment 2: List Operations

A Python program that demonstrates basic list operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an element.  
See [assignment-2/README.md](assignment-2/README.md) for details.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the assignment directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the respective `README.md` file to run the code.


### Assignment 3: Discount Calculator

A python program that calculates discount of a given price. See [assignment-3/README.md](assignment-3/README.md) for details.

### Assignment 4: File Operations
This Python program reads the content of a specified text file. It first reads 'gospel.txt' and displays its content, then prompts the user to enter another filename and safely reads that file, handling errors if the file does not exist or cannot be accessed.


## How to Use

1. Navigate to the assignment directory.
2. Follow the instructions in the respective `README.md` file to run the code.

This repository will be updated with more assignments as the course progresses.


## Assignment 5: OOP Practice

This Python program demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It includes two main parts:

1. **Assignment 1: Smartphone Class**  
   - A `Smartphone` class that inherits from a `Device` class.  
   - Demonstrates constructors, inheritance, and encapsulation.  
   - Allows creating smartphone objects, checking battery level, using the phone, and charging it.

2. **Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge**  
   - Defines an `Animal` base class and subclasses `Dog`, `Fish`, and `Bird`.  
   - Each subclass implements the `move()` method differently to demonstrate polymorphism.

The program features a simple **menu** so users can run either part separately or both together.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the assignment directory.
2. Run the program using:
```bash
python oop_assignment1.py
