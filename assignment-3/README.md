# Discount Calculator Program

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. If the discount percentage is 20% or more, the program applies the discount to the original price. Otherwise, it returns the original price.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter the original price of the item.
2. The user is prompted to enter the discount percentage.
3. If the discount percentage is 20% or more, the program calculates and displays the discounted price.
4. If the discount percentage is less than 20%, the program displays the original price.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Run the program using the command:

   ```
   python discount_calculater.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter the original price and discount percentage.

## Example

```
Input the original price: 100
Input the discount percentage: 25
75.0
```
